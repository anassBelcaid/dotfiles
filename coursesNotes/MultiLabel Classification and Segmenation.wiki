=Multi Label Classification and Segmenatation= 

I learnt that applications with  Sattelite data are the trends.


== Todo s ==

* [X] Install *kaggle* for the fastai virtual env
  * Basically the main command is
    {{{bash
    kaggle competitions download -c competition_name -f file_name
    !kaggle competitions files -c planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space
    }}}
* [X] Revisit the *kaggle syntax* for downloading datasets
* [X] Check the **from_csv* loader in fastai 
* [X] Check the definition of **ImageMultiDataset*
* [X] Check the *get_transforms* that always comes after loading a datset
* [X] Definition of *partial* in defining the learning rate
* [X] Check *DataLoader* with your porper class on Berkeley
