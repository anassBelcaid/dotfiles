= BackPropagation and SGD from Scratch=

Practically know all the material. Thanks to the cs231 course. But nevertheless,
check at least one tutorial on the library.


== Collaborative filtering ==

* [X] Finish two notebook in the *fastai* library
* [ ] Create a custom *pytorch* nn and feed it to the fastai.
* [X] *Discriminative* learning rate
* [X] Interpretation *top_movies*
* [X] Command in pandas to get the most rated movies
* [X] Get *internals* of a Collaborative learner
* [X] Check how to sort by *bias* ( cool trick)
* [X] Get and vizualize the weights
* [X] Check *itemgetter* for weights visualization
* [X] Draw movies in a *graph*
* [X] Check the implementation of the *EmbeddingDotBias* with torch integration
* [ ] Embedding are amazing

== SGD from Scratch ==

* [X] Review lesson 2 **SGD** 
* [X] Reconstruct the **Mnist** notebook
* [X] *gzip* In pure python or fastai
* [X] *TensorDataset* from a tensor
* [X] Cool *DataBunch.create* from a dataset
* [X]  dataBunch.*train_dl* as a generator
* [X] Creating *nn.Module* for Mnist_Logistic
* [X] pytorch *nn.Linear*
* [X] Implementation *Mnist_NN* and *optim.Adam*
* [X] constructor for *Learner*
