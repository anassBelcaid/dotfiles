= NLP, Tabular Data, Collaborative Filtering =


In this lesson we will learn about the following topics:

* Natural Language processing.
* Tabular Data
* Collaborative Filtering
* Word Embedding


== Journey==


=== Natural Language Processing ===
* [X] Check the  model for Wikipedia *wiki3*
      (https://blog.einstein.ai/the-wikitext-long-term-dependency-language-modeling-dataset/)
* [X] Fix the Error for the *isinstance*
* [X] Check the definition of *language_model_learner*
* [X] Check the *moms* key argument in fit on cycle
  * *moms*: is simply the momentum range for the optimizer.
* [X] Check the *predict* function for a clause with _temperature_ and _min_p_
* [X] Function *save_encoder* to save only the word encoding
* [X] Check the *TextFilesList* constructor and the argument *vocab*
* [X] Check *text_classifier_learner*
* [X] *feeze_to* to fix the number of layer 

=== Tabular Data ===

* New Era as classical machine learning the standard in this type of
  applications.
  
* [X] Check the preprocessing steps [FillMissing, Categorify, Normalize]
* [X] Check the two class for Tabular data *TabularList*
* [X] variable name *layers* in the *tabular_learner*

=== Collaborative Filtering ===

* [X] Check the *movieLens* toplay with
* [X] Definition of *ColabDataBunch*
* [ ] Check the *n_factors* arugment
* [ ] Learn how to jump between symbols
* [ ] Jump from symbol to its implementation
* [ ] Check how to communicate between fastai classses and pytorch.
* [ ] What is  a *embedding_dot_bias*
